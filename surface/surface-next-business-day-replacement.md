# Next Business Day Replacement information & coverage areas

Next Business Day Replacement is a paid-for service where a replacement Surface device will be delivered to your premises by the next business day. 

Next Business Day Replacement is available with Complete for Business Plus protection plans in the United States, Canada, Europe (limited to United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Belgium, Austria), Australia, Singapore, and Japan. These services apply after an agent has determined a replacement device is required, we have available inventory, and order a replacement by a standard cutoff time, predetermined by Microsoft.  

To guarantee delivery for a replacement device by the next business day, device replacement requests must be completed by the following cutoff times (per locale).
