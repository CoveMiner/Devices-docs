# Surface Laptop processors technical overview

Surface Laptop 4 is designed to provide commercial customers with a rich set device options to enable all of their employee scenarios with more choice and flexibility to help decision makers better align device procurement goals with increasingly specific role requirements. Compared with Laptop 3:

- Surface Laptop 4 equipped with AMD Ryzen Microsoft Surface Edition processors provides superior multithreading performance making it a great choice for information workers needing better multitasking capabilities.
- Surface Laptop 4 equipped with 11th gen Intel Core processors provide a stronger GPU and faster single threaded performance, making it a great choice for developers, researchers, data scientists and the like -- especially when paired with the greater memory and storage offered in the top end Intel SKU.

For everyday usage, there’s roughly equivalent performance on Surface Laptop 4 running AMD Ryzen Microsoft Surface Edition or Intel 11th gen Core processors. Choice of SKU depends on customer priorities:

- If multithreaded app performance and longer battery life is a top priority, AMD is a good choice.
- If faster single threaded performance is more important, along with options for greater memory and storage, Intel is a good choice.
