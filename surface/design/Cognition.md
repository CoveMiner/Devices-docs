# What is cognition?

Cognition involves our ability to receive, interpret, and process information. This includes attention, awareness, focus, memory, judgment, comprehension, problem solving, and reasoning. A person’s cognition can affect the way they learn—whether this is learning how to use a new device or learning new information in a classroom.

Many aspects of cognition affect one another. If a person has difficulty with attention, or problems focusing after an interruption, this may lead to issues with comprehension. Similarly, if a person has trouble understanding information, it might be difficult to commit the information to memory. This can influence a person’s confidence and motivation in learning something new. Cognition is essential to every task we perform.

**[Attention](Cognition_Attention.md)** &mdash; Are notifications, animations, or distractions present during the experience?

**[Memory](Cognition_Memory.md)** &mdash; Does the experience require memorized information in order to complete a task?

**[Judgment](Cognition_Judgment.md)** &mdash; Is the experience intuitive and familiar to navigate?

**[Processing (speed)](Cognition_Processing_Speed.md)** &mdash; Are there timed responses that could expire before the user can act upon them?

**[Processing (comprehension)](Cognition_Processing_Comprehension.md)** &mdash; Is there new information being presented to the user during the experience?
