# What is voice, speech, and communication?

Our ability to communicate (verbally or non-verbally) is essential in expressing wants and needs, forming relationships, conveying information to others, and interacting with our environment. Our ability to produce speech is determined by a complex sequence of physical and cognitive demands. Cognitive disabilities may cause difficulty with communication. Some disabilities donâ€™t affect a person cognitively, however, they may cause difficulties with strength and coordination of mouth movement. This could affect the ability to produce speech that's clear enough or loud enough to be understood. A person with hearing loss may also choose to communicate through non-verbal means.
