# Configure Android Enterprise Work Profile for Surface Duo

Targeted at  BYOD deployments, work profiles provide a separate space on Duo for work apps and data, giving organizations full control of their data, apps, and security policies without preventing employees from using their device for personal apps and data.

### Setup Android Enterprise Work Profile

Use work profiles to manage corporate data and apps on user-owned Android devices. By default, enrollment of personally owned work profile devices is enabled and requires no further admin configuration.  d

**To enable Enterprise Work Profile:**

- In Endpoint Manager, select **Devices** > **Android** > **Android enrollment** and then select **Personal devices with work profile**.

6. When you have activated the work profile, select Continue to update device settings.  If your company app protection policy requires stronger authentication than the default 4-character numerical passcode, review the guidance and select **Continue**.

**Note:** In this example, the work profile applies an MDM setting to require a stronger password â€” 6 characters long continuing both numbers and letters.
