# Install and mount Surface Hub 2S 85”

This article provides guidance for physically installing Microsoft Surface Hub 2S 85" in commercial environments. 


## Handling and site prep

- Before moving the device to the place where it will be installed, survey the site to determine how to safely move it to the location where it will be unpacked and mounted.
- Always use at least two people for unpacking and installation.
- Once the device is unpacked, it should be mounted
immediately, so the mounting system should be in place before unpacking. If you’re mounting onto a rolling stand, lock or block the wheels of the stand before unpacking.
- To avoid tripping hazards, keep the assembly area clear of packing materials.

> [!WARNING]
> Heavy object/ergonomic lifting
> The device is very heavy. To reduce the risk of lifting-related injuries, death, or damage to the device, we recommend that a minimum of two or more people lift the device. It is important to use proper lifting posture when lifting and/or moving the device.

Use good ergonomic lifting practices, including but not limited to:

- Plan ahead. Make sure the lifting team agrees on the plan.
- Determine if you can lift the unit. Is it too heavy or too awkward?
- Decide if you need lifting aid.
- Check your environment for obstructions and slippery surfaces.
- Lift with your legs, not your back.
- Bend at your knees, keeping the back straight.
- Keep the unit close to your body.
- Center your body over the unit. Keep the feet about shoulder width apart.
- Lift straight up smoothly.
- Keep your torso straight; do not twist while lifting or after the load is lifted
