# Migrate to Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise on Surface Hub 2

## Introduction

Surface Hub 2S comes pre-installed with Windows 10 Team, a customized edition of Windows 10 designed to facilitate easy collaboration in meeting room environments. Now you have the option of running Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise to use Surface Hub 2S much like any other PC. 

You start the migration from Windows 10 Team using a separate PC and downloadable tool -- **Surface UEFI Configurator** --  to create a package containing a new UEFI setting that you apply to Surface Hub 2S.  Surface UEFI Configurator functions as an interface into Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM), designed to facilitate centralized management of firmware settings on Surface devices in a corporate environment. To learn more about SEMM, see [Microsoft Surface Enterprise Management Mode documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode).
 

### Solution Components

## Verify UEFI version on Surface Hub 2S meets minimum requirements

The minimum UEFI version required prior to migrating the Surface Hub from Windows 10 Team to Windows 10 Desktop is **694.2938.768.0**.
 
**To verify the current UEFI version on your system:**

1. On Surface Hub 2S home screen, select **Start** and open the **Surface** **App** (**All Apps** > **Surface**).
2. Select **Your Surface** to display information about the Surface Hub, including the current version of the UEFI on the device. If the UEFI version is **694.2938.768.0** or later as shown below, the UEFI is eligible for you to create the SEMM package to enable OS migration.<br><br>
 ![alt text](images/sh2mfig1.png)<br><br>
1. If the UEFI version is earlier than version 694.2938.768.0, you will need to obtain a current version using Windows Update.

**To update UEFI from Windows Update:**
1. On your Surface Hub 2S, sign in as an **Admin**, go to **All apps** > **Settings**> **Update and Security** > **Windows Update** and install all updates, then restart the device. Verify the UEFI version using the Surface App. Note: If you do not know your username or admin password, you will need to reset the device. To learn more, see [Reset and recovery for Surface Hub 2S](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-recover-reset).
2. Repeat these steps until the UEFI version is **694.2938.768.0** or later.
3. If you still do not see the updated UEFI after multiple attempts, check **Update History** and look for any instances of failed firmware installations. You may need to reset your device (**Settings** > **Update & security** > **Reset device**).

## Download Surface UEFI Configurator and Surface Hub software & drivers

On a separate PC:

- Download and install Microsoft [Surface UEFI Configurator](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=46703) from Surface Tools for IT. (Surface UEFI Configurator cannot be run on Surface Hub 2S, while Windows 10 Team is installed).
- Download Surface Hub software & drivers Windows Installer .MSI package to be applied when installing the new operating system.

## Prepare SEMM certificate

If this is your first time using Surface UEFI Configurator, youâ€™ll need to prepare a certificate. This certificate ensures that after a device is enrolled in SEMM, only packages created with the approved certificate can be used to modify UEFI settings. How you acquire a certificate may vary depending on the size or complexity of your organization:

- Large enterprise organizations typically maintain their own certificate infrastructure to generate certificates per standard security practices.
- Medium-sized businesses and others may choose to obtain a certificate from third party providers. This is the recommended option for organizations without sufficient IT expertise or dedicated IT security team.
- Alternatively, you can generate a self-signed certificate with a PowerShell script per the following documentation: [Surface Enterprise Management Mode certificate requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode#surface-enterprise-management-mode-certificate-requirements). Or use PowerShell to create your own certificate per the following documentation: [New-SelfSignedCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=win10-ps).

The SEMM package must be secured with a certificate to verify the signature of configuration files before UEFI settings can be applied. To learn more, see [Surface Enterprise Management Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode) documentation.
