# Modern authentication on Surface Hub

The Windows 10 Team 2020 Update adds support for modern authentication of the Hub device account in some scenarios. Once you install the 2020 update, you can migrate from legacy basic authentication to make use of the latest security improvements if the device account authenticates via Azure Active Directory and the account's mailbox is hosted in Exchange Online. With the 2020 Update, Surface Hub supports Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocols and Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) based authentication when syncing the device account with Exchange Online.

For new cloud-based accounts, Surface Hub automatically uses Modern Authentication to connect to Exchange Online without requiring additional configuration beyond simply creating device accounts using the format [alias@contoso.com](mailto:alias@contoso.com). Do not use the legacy format â€“ Contoso\alias, which is not supported for modern authentication. For more information, see [Create Surface Hub 2S device account](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-account).

> [!NOTE]
> Surface Hub does not support modern authentication for on-premises accounts. The accounts must be created in the cloud.
