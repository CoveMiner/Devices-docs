# Install Windows 10 Team 2020 Update Preview Build 

The latest update of the Surface Hub operating system, Windows 10 Team 2020 Update, is now available at no additional cost for all first-generation Surface Hub and Surface Hub 2S devices from the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/).

Windows 10 Team 2020 Update brings major improvements to device deployment and manageability along with the latest Windows 10 features. To learn more about whatâ€™s new, see the following blog post: New Surface Hub OS update released for public preview.
