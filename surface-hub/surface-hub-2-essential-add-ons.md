## Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader

if youâ€™re running Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise on Surface Hub 2, you can sign in using the optional Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader, a biometric authentication option that uses [Windows Hello](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello).

**To use Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader:**

1. Insert the fingerprint reader into any of the USB C bezel ports, located on each side of the device.
2. **Go to Start** > **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Sign-in options** > **Windows Hello Fingerprint** to enroll your fingerprint.

For more information about configuring the fingerprint reader to sign in using Windows Hello, see the following:

| Component                       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **USB**                         | USB-C 2.0 full speed                                                                                                                 |
| **System requirement**          | Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise.                                                                                               |
| **Windows certification**       | Windows 10                                                                                                                           |
| **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**  | < 10%. FRR is the proportion of times a biometric system fails to grant access to authorized users.                                  |
| **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)** | 1/1.5 million. FAR shows the probability of a biometric security system to incorrectly accept access attempts by unauthorized users. |
| **Maximum fingerprints**        | > 300                                                                                                                                |
| **Maximum latency**             | <2s (with 300 FPs)                                                                                                                   |

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10 Team, which runs on Surface Hub 2S does not support the Surface Hub 2 Fingerprint Reader. This is because Windows 10 Team is designed to allow multiple users to interact with the device in a conference room environment. You now have the option of [migrating from Windows 10 Team to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-migrate-os), which lets you use Surface Hub 2 much like any other computer.
 
## **Windows Hello face recognition**

Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise on Surface Hub 2 supports Windows Hello for authentication and requires a Windows Hello certified camera accessory. Note that the built-in camera for Surface Hub 2S is not designed for authentication and does not support Windows Hello. For more information, see [Windows Hello.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello)


## Audio and video accessories

You can extend the audio and video capabilities of Surface Hub 2 with audio and camera peripherals using the USB-C or USB-A ports.
