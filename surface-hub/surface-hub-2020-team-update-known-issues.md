| Proxy authentication fails when Device Account is entered as domain\alias (on Active Directory configurations).            | When the Device Account is configured in OOBE/Settings/MDM using the domain\alias format and the device is using the Device Account for proxy authentication, the Device Account is not properly passed to the Proxy. As a result of this configuration, the proxy does not detect the Device Account as a valid user to authenticate and rejects the request. When this occurs the device cannot connect to internal or external networks. | No remedy at this time. Surface Hubs configured to use the device account for proxy authentication should not install the 2020 update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Calendar sync with on-premises mailboxes fails if customer does not support Hybrid Modern Authentication.   | Hubs are trying to force Hybrid Modern Authentication for on-premises devices when customers have not enabled this in their topologies. In this scenario, Exchange stops syncing meetings to the device. As a result, the device does not receive new meetings.                                                                                                                                        | Customers can enable Hybrid Modern Authentication on their on-premises Exchange Server -- but only if their topology allows it.

| Sign in is impacted when Conditional Access policy settings are applied.                                    | When a device is configured using a Compliance policy setting that requires device-level information (for example, “Require Firewall”), a Conditional Access Error 53000 is triggered. When this occurs users cannot sign in to the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Customers can exclude Compliance policy settings that require device-level information from executing on Surface Hub devices. If this is not possible due to compliance or security restrictions, Hub devices should not install the 2020 update.<br> <br>**Learn more**: [Use compliance policies to set rules for devices you manage with Intune](https:/docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started). |
